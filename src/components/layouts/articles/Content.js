      <p style="margin: 0 0 10px 0;">Want to improve your push-up strength?</p>
      <p style="margin: 0 0 10px 0;">Whether you have a goal to achieve your first full push-up or increase the number of push-ups you can do, these workouts will help!</p>
      
      <p style="margin: 0 0 10px 0;">Push-ups are a compound exercise, meaning that they target many muscles at once. All of the workouts below include push-ups or exercises that support the development of the muscles necessary to perform a push-up: chest presses, chest flies, planks, and more. These workouts also incorporate a variety of push-up variations to support diverse muscle development. The training types below are primarily strength training but also include a little yoga, cardio, and more. This list is not meant to be followed in a programmatic manner (in a specific order) but rather to give you a sense of the types of workouts that will help you work toward this goal.</p>

          <strong>Upper Body Workout to Build Strength for Push-Ups — Daniel, Free</strong>
          <p style="margin: 0 0 10px 0;">This 12-minute add-on workout is a great way to practice your basic push-ups.</p>
          <p style="margin: 0 0 10px 0;">“This upper body workout makes for a great burnout round, and it’s excellent for increasing strength in order to be able to do more push ups. You can use this at the end of a longer workout, or you can add a warm up and cool down and use it as a standalone routine. This exercise works for many different fitness levels, with small modifications. If you are new to building strength, we recommend doing the push up exercises with your hands on a wall, or elevated bench. On the other hand, if you want to make this more difficult, you can elevate your feet during the push ups, or wear a weighted vest in order to make this workout much more difficult.” — Daniel</p>

          <strong>Upper Body Strength Circuit Training with Push-Ups Intermissions — Tasha, FB Plus</strong>
          <p style="margin: 0 0 10px 0;">Want to experiment with various push-up variations? This workout is a great option.</p>
          <p style="margin: 0 0 10px 0;">“There are plenty of repetitions to enjoy in this upper body focused strength routine! We target the major push and pull muscles in this multi-circuit session with a secondary focus on a few push-ups variations during the intermissions. Why push-ups? Although push-ups are a standard foundational movement pattern that precludes several other exercises, they are still a particularly challenging exercise for most of us. Many of us avoid them for this reason; however, like with any other difficult exercise, skill, or unfamiliar activity, intentional practice with incremental progressions will help us tackle the notoriously disliked push-up. Note that the push-ups variations in this workout are a bit more challenging than a regular/basic push-up, so feel free to take on any modification or alternative that matches your current physical capabilities.” — Tasha</p>

          <strong>Upper Body Strength with Push Intervals — Nicole, Plus</strong>
          <p style="margin: 0 0 10px 0;">Challenge your muscles with the unique format of this workout, which involves long strength intervals paired with short bursts (aka “push” intervals) that’ll test your muscle endurance and target smaller support muscles.</p>
          <p style="margin: 0 0 10px 0;">“This is a well-rounded routine that covers every single muscle group in your upper body. We’ll be using dumbbells (medium and heavy) as well as your own bodyweight to strengthen and fatigue each muscle group in a functional way. If you’re not familiar with the format, it’s a bit unique. We have 4 supersets of 2 exercises each. The first exercise (A) will be 1 minute long. Following that, we have a short 15 second transition before performing a “push” exercise (B) for 30 seconds. For the longer rounds (exercise A), our goal is to build strength. Pick up heavier weights and slow down the movement. Exercise B will hone in on the smaller, complementary muscle groups. Aim to “push” for as many reps as possible (safely, of course). This may require lighter weights or simply bodyweight.” — Nicole</p>

          <strong>Upper Body Push Muscles with Kickboxing Finisher — Erica, Plus</strong>
          <p style="margin: 0 0 10px 0;">This workout focuses on “strengthening the upper body muscles that complete pushing motions; the chest, shoulders, and triceps. The back and biceps will be incorporated as well, they just won’t be a primary focus. To jazz up this upper body strength day, we do a 5-minute kickboxing finisher to elevate the heart rate and fire up the pushing muscles in a new way.” — Erica</p>
          <p style="margin: 0 0 10px 0;">Expect tricep push-ups, offset push-ups, and plenty of chest exercises!</p>
          <p style="margin: 0 0 10px 0;">This workout is part of the 10-Day Challenge: Transform with Erica — if you like it, check out the whole challenge!</p>

          <strong>Upper Body Strength with Bonus Pulses for Stabilizing Muscle Activation — Amanda, Free</strong>
          <p style="margin: 0 0 10px 0;">If you feel a little unsteady throughout your push-ups, this workout with Amanda might help, as it utilizes both full ranges of motion (to target your larger muscle groups) as well as pulsing through smaller ranges of motion (to target your smaller stabilizer muscles).</p>
          <p style="margin: 0 0 10px 0;">Why is this beneficial? “Much like an isometric exercise, working through the smaller range of motion places less load through the joint, can help build strength and power, and help with injury prevention. Moving through a larger range of motion engages the larger global muscles while pulsing through a smaller range of motion activates the stabilizing musculature.” — Amanda</p>

          <strong>Push Pull AMRAP Strength Sets for Balanced Upper Body Muscle Development — Brian, Plus</strong>
          <p style="margin: 0 0 10px 0;">Want to improve your push-ups more efficiently? This push/pull workout from Brian is a great option.</p>
          <p style="margin: 0 0 10px 0;">“Let's discuss the benefits of a push-pull workout and the exercises for today's session. A push-pull workout is a great way to target different muscle groups efficiently. By combining pushing and pulling movements, we engage the pushing muscles (like the chest, shoulders, and triceps) and the pulling muscles (like the back and biceps). This balanced approach helps muscle development and promotes overall strength and stability. It's a strategy I like to use for a well-rounded upper-body workout.” — Brian</p>
          <p style="margin: 0 0 10px 0;">This workout is part of the 5-Day Challenge: Advanced Strength with Brian. If you enjoy Brian’s style here, you might like the full challenge!</p>

          <strong>Unconventional Upper Body and Core: Descending Strength Intervals with Cardio — Kayla, Plus</strong>
          <p style="margin: 0 0 10px 0;">As we mentioned before, push-ups are a compound movement that involves various muscle groups. This workout from Kayla includes unique exercises that target not only your chest, but also your core stability and shoulder mobility — two important components in mastering the push-up.</p>
          <p style="margin: 0 0 10px 0;">“Carve out 30 minutes of your day for an unconventional upper body and core workout with me! These unique bodyweight exercises combine strength, shoulder mobility, and core stability to pack a serious punch in a short amount of time. While this workout is not quite equipment-free, you can easily use towels, sliders, or even socks to get the job done.” — Kayla</p>
        </li>

        <li style="margin-bottom: 20px;">
          <strong>Yoga-Inspired Burnout for Upper Body Strength — Marina, Plus</strong>
          <p style="margin: 0 0 10px 0;">Strength training isn’t the only way to improve your push-up! This yoga-inspired workout with Marina includes movements that’ll challenge your triceps, chest, shoulders, and more — including the chaturanga (aka Low Plank) which is similar to a push-up.</p>
          <p style="margin: 0 0 10px 0;">If you’re running short on time and looking for a quick upper body focused workout, this ~ spicy ~ 15-minute practice has got your triceps and shoulders covered! The low-impact movements offered in this quick-paced class will challenge your overall upper body strength and mobility while helping you to identify and work into smaller muscle groups (that often get overlooked with isometric contractions) with dynamic exercises. I offer opportunities to practice complete presence and resilience as we challenge our bodies with unfamiliar movements and moments of intense muscle burn.” — Marina</p>

          <strong>“Work Out With Me” Freestyle Upper Body Strength Workout for People Who Get Bored Easily — Kelli, Plus</strong>
          <p style="margin: 0 0 10px 0;">Improving your push-ups doesn’t have to be boring. If you get bored doing repetitive strength sets, you might enjoy Kelli’s freestyle workout for people who get bored easily.</p>
          <p style="margin: 0 0 10px 0;">“Grab your dumbbells and get ready to work! Today we’re treating our upper body muscles to a fun, thorough workout. We'll be doing everything from traditional strength sets, isometrics, isolation and alternating strength moves, bodyweight exercises, and more!” — Kelli</p>

        ">Our body image is not something we often take the time to explicitly think about. Thoughts and feelings about our bodies are always running in the background, but are not always part of our conscious narrative. Because of this, our body image can impact our decisions around food and movement without our awareness — and sometimes in unhelpful ways. Therefore, the purpose of the following journal prompts is to get you thinking about how you think and feel about your body and to be intentional about working toward a body image that supports a thriving life.</p>

        ">Body image is generally defined as the way we perceive, think, and feel about our bodies (Grogan, 2006). Therefore, doing body image work means actively working toward modifying the way we view, think, or feel about our bodies. There is no one prescribed way to go about this work, but we know that positive health behaviors are more likely to occur for folks who have a more positive body image.</p>

        ">Some people may want to work on a more realistic view of their body. Others may want to feel more positively or even feel neutrally about their body. However, regardless of what we are working on, I want us to move away from ever feeling like we have “arrived” at a positive (or negative) body image space. Our relationship with our bodies is going to shift based on many internal and external factors. However, finding ways to actively work on our body image means that we will have the tools to cope when we have our down days, weeks, or months (which we all have).</p>

Feel free to write a bulleted list, type up your thoughts, or even audio record them on your phone.

          <li><strong>Reading and learning:</strong> Learn about different perspectives or philosophies in the body image world. Read experiences of other people who have struggled with their own body image and how they overcame it.</li>
          <li><strong>Building community:</strong> Talk to trusted others about your body image and get their perspectives and experiences with the same thing. The Community page at Fitness Blender is a great place to do this!</li>
          <li><strong>Mentality:</strong> Identify self-defeating thoughts that get in your way of being able to maintain your body image goals. Cognitive distortions can often keep us in a negative headspace, so learn to identify and modify them in your everyday life.</li>
          <li><strong>Self-talk and self-compassion:</strong> Identify the running monologue in your mind and whether it is working in your favor. Regardless, practicing self-compassion can really help to enhance your body image.</li>
          <li><strong>Therapy:</strong> Everyone can benefit from therapy at some point, in my opinion. If you feel you are struggling with body image (or any related concerns), seek out mental health support.</li>
          <li><strong>Identify values:</strong> If we no longer value or place emphasis on how we look, then we need to identify the things in our lives that do matter to us. Everyone’s values are different, but can serve as a driver for what we focus on.</li>
          <li><strong>General mindfulness:</strong> So much pertaining to our body image and related thoughts and emotions happens outside of our conscious awareness. Therefore, practicing mindfulness can help us to tap into what we are thinking or feeling in any given moment.</li>
          <li><strong>Mindful eating and movement:</strong> Stay present when you are eating meals and getting in movement. Be sure to identify how what you eat and how you move make you feel physically and emotionally. Try to maximize the foods and movements that help you to work toward your personal goals.</li>
          <li><strong>Social media:</strong> Social media can influence how we think about ourself and the world. So, if you are looking to modify your mindset, learn to critically examine social media content. For some, it can be helpful to follow social media accounts that align with your views — and unfollow those who don’t!</li>

        <h1>The Relationship Between Personality Traits and Exercise Behavior</h1>

        <h4>Read Time • 9 Min</h4> <br/>

        <p>A wonderful part of the human experience is that we are all different. Every person has a different combination of personality traits, contributing to what makes us a unique individual. These personality traits bleed into every component of our lives, helping to explain why we do what we do — health and wellness included.</p>

        <p>Sport psychologists have long been interested in why different people succeed at different types or levels of sports in an attempt to identify and promote success within the sports world. As a result, many scholars have conducted research on how personality types impact sport performance. While this is not necessarily helpful for the everyday person, this research has been extended to examine differences in physical activity types and levels as a means of health promotion.</p>

        <p>Therefore, this article will explore the primary model of personality traits and share the current research on the links between personality traits and sport/physical activity performance. Hopefully, this will help you to understand how your own personality potentially impacts your exercise behaviors.</p>

        <h2>Five Factor Model of Personality (a.k.a. the “Big 5”)</h2>
        <p>The predominant model of classifying personality traits within the field of Psychology is known as the five factor model of personality — or, the “Big 5.” Essentially, there are five personality trait dimensions that account for the wide variety of traits that we see within human personalities. These are long-lasting traits that categorize people’s thoughts, feelings, and actions (McCrae & Costa, 2008). Many folks use the acronym(s) OCEAN or CANOE to help remember these personality traits described below:</p>

        <ul>
          <li><strong>Openness to experience:</strong> People who are high in openness tend to have a wide range of interests and are willing to be creative and try out new things. They also tend to be a bit more adventurous. People low in openness dislike change, trying new things, or abstract concepts.</li>
          <li><strong>Conscientiousness:</strong> People high in conscientiousness are generally fairly thoughtful, task-focused, and orderly in their goal pursuits. They tend to plan ahead and think about the way things are interacting to get things done. People low in conscientiousness tend to dislike structure and routine and sometimes struggle with getting things done in a timely manner.</li>
          <li><strong>Extraversion:</strong> People high in extraversion tend to be assertive and sociable, talkative, and express a lot of emotions. They tend to thrive in social situations. People low in this personality trait tend to find social situations draining (though they still may be competent in them) and dislike being the center of attention.</li>
          <li><strong>Agreeableness:</strong> People who are high in agreeableness are highly cooperative and polite, preferring to keep the peace rather than create conflict. People low in agreeableness tend to take little interest in other people or their needs.</li>
          <li><strong>Neuroticism:</strong> People who are high in neuroticism are prone to experiencing negative emotions like anxiety, depression, and irritation. These folks tend to get upset fairly easily and experience significant highs and lows in moods. People low in neuroticism deal well with distress, are generally relaxed, and can be classified as emotionally stable.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>The great thing about these five personality traits is that there are strengths associated with each of them. For example, folks who are high in neuroticism (often considered a less desirable trait) also tend to be highly intelligent and have a strong sense of humor. There is no one personality trait that is considered “good” or “bad,” though some facets of particular traits may help you to adapt and cope with life challenges more than others (McCrae & Costa, 2008; Cherry, 2022).</p>

        <p>It is important to note here that while we can often see ourselves within these different personality traits, a true personality test should be administered by a trained professional. The various free quizzes you take online are not always valid or reliable indicators of your true personality (especially if it is telling you your personality in the form of a pasta shape or something similar).</p>

        <h2>Big 5 and Exercise</h2>
        <p>Research shows that people with different personality traits have different tendencies when it comes to their sport and physical activity behaviors. An important caveat to introduce here is that these are not necessarily causal relationships, meaning having a particular personality trait does not guarantee 100% that a person will do or think any one thing. What I am presenting here are simply tendencies within each personality trait.</p>

        <p>Three of the personality traits (conscientiousness, extraversion, and neuroticism) have each been consistently linked with significant athletic and physical exercise tendencies. Conscientious people generally tend to engage in more positive health behaviors and a greater variety of healthy behaviors throughout their entire lives (Hoyt et al., 2009). Athletes also tend to score higher on conscientiousness than non-athletes (Malinauskas et al., 2014). There are likely a few reasons for these differences. First, they tend to have better preparation strategies, take fewer risks, and have more effective coping strategies that make their physical activity more likely and consistent (Allen & Laborde, 2014). Second, conscientious people tend to have greater self-regulation and self-discipline to turn their health-related intentions into actual behaviors (Rhodes et al., 2005). Third, exercise satisfies a need for competence and gives conscientious folks greater intrinsic pleasure/motivation (Ingledew et al., 2004). Finally, conscientious people tend to have internalized an athletic-ideal body type, meaning they tend to seek out an athletic appearance (for example, highly muscular; Martin & Racine, 2017). Therefore, it may be important for folks who are lower in conscientiousness to be more intentional about self-discipline and finding the pleasure and joy in exercise.</p>

        <p>People high in extraversion tend to have greater levels of physical activity and respond to unsuccessful outcomes with more adaptability, holding more positive cognitive and emotional responses (Allen & Laborde, 2014). Additionally, they tend to be on team sports over endurance-based sports (Malinauskas et al., 2014), likely due to team sports fulfilling a need for connection and socializing held by extraverts (Ingledew). Furthermore, extraverts who are specifically more adventurous (a subcomponent of extraversion) tend to be more familiar with exercise and perceive it to be under their control, resulting in more exercise behaviors (Rhodes et al., 2005). At the same time, extraversion is related to greater levels of compulsive exercise as well (Martin & Racine, 2017). If you find that you are low in extraversion, consider finding the reasons that physical activity and movement are important for you outside of connection with others.</p>

        <p>When it comes to neuroticism, there are mixed findings with regards to exercise. People who are more neurotic — and specifically high in the subcomponent of insecurity — tend to be more normatively influenced and will exercise if they receive guidance and social cues that this is desirable (Rhodes et al., 2005). Furthermore, people who are less neurotic tend to be more self-determined in their exercise, meaning they are more likely to follow through with any planned exercise routines and perceive exercise as more pleasurable (Martin & Racine, 2017). For example, individuals who are high in neuroticism tend to exercise to relieve stress or avoid negative emotions (Ingledew et al., 2004). If you are high in neuroticism, it might be helpful to consider engaging in exercise that helps you cope with any emotional stress and exercise in ways that help you feel positive and empowered. Consider also seeking support from a health professional if this is an ongoing struggle.</p>

        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <p>Many of us want to exercise, but the best way to achieve our goals may be different for each of us based on our individual personalities. If you find that you have certain traits that align with less frequent or inconsistent physical activity, it might be beneficial to find ways to harness your strengths within these traits and build upon them. For instance, individuals who are high in conscientiousness might benefit from a regular exercise schedule to keep them on track, whereas those who are high in extraversion might benefit from group exercise classes. Consider how you can play to your strengths and work to improve any barriers to exercise that you may have in an effort to achieve your health and fitness goals.</p>

    <h1>Understanding Body Dysmorphia</h1>
    <h4>Read Time • 6 Min</h4> <br/>

    <p><strong>Content Warning (CW):</strong> In addition to the discussion of body dysmorphia, this article will touch on the topics of trauma, depression, and suicidal ideation.</p>

    <p>Body image concerns are unfortunately quite common amongst people of all demographic factors throughout the world. In a global society that places significant value on the appearance of one’s body, it is no wonder that so many of us question our bodies regularly. However, what happens when those concerns are at their most severe?</p>

    <p>Body dysmorphia, a severe type of body image concern, impacts anywhere from 1.8 to 2.4% of the population and is linked with significant negative mental health outcomes (Malcolm et al., 2021). It is particularly important for folks in the fitness world to be knowledgeable about this disorder, as it is common amongst people who seek to change some aspect of their bodies, including through exercise. This article will describe what body dysmorphia is and what you need to know if you or someone you know ever experiences it.</p>

    <h2>What is Body Dysmorphia?</h2>
    <p>Body dysmorphia, or more accurately Body Dysmorphic Disorder (BDD), is a mental health condition in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual in which a person perceives that they have some sort of flaw with their body and experiences prolonged preoccupation with this flaw. This imperfection, though very real to the individual, is not visible to others, suggesting a potentially distorted self-perception. The preoccupations with one’s body can center around one or more areas of the body, and the most common concerns are with one’s skin, hair, and/or nose (APA, 2013).</p>

    <p>In addition, folks with BDD tend to have repetitive thoughts or behaviors that are in response to their distorted perception of the self. It is common for folks with BDD to frequently check their appearance in the mirror, groom excessively, seek reassurance from others, and engage in social comparison. Most importantly, this preoccupation and the resulting thoughts and behaviors cause significant distress for the individual and often impairment in their ability to function at work, academic, social, or other arenas of life (APA, 2013). The average age of onset of BDD is 16.7 years of age, with 67.2% of people experiencing the onset of symptoms by 18 years of age (Bjornsson et al., 2014).</p>

    <p>It is also common for people with BDD to experience ideas or delusions of reference which, in the case of BDD, are beliefs that others are overly concerned with their appearance or that others are mocking them for their appearance (APA, 2013). Additionally, there is evidence that people with BDD tend to 1) hyperfocus on minor visual details and overlook the bigger picture (in general, but particularly when it comes to their body), 2) interpret non-threatening scenarios as threatening, 3) overestimate attractiveness of others’ faces, and 4) misinterpret neutral emotional expressions as contemptuous and angry (Bjornsson et al., 2022).</p>

    <h2>Gender Differences in BDD</h2>
    <p>Research suggests that BDD impacts men and women at the same rates, though some of the ways it manifests tend to be gender-specific.</p>

    <p>Body dysmorphia in women tends to lead to more significant distress (Malcolm et al., 2021) and women tend to engage in more repetitive behaviors like mirror checking or reassurance seeking (Phillips et al., 2006). However, women’s body focus tends to skew more towards the following bodily concerns:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Body fat (Himanshu et al., 2020)</li>
      <li>Facial hair (Himanshu et al., 2020)</li>
      <li>Legs (Malcolm et al., 2021)</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Men with BDD are more likely to be older, single, and live alone (when compared to women). They also are more likely to engage in camouflaging behaviors, which are when they try to hide or cover up their perceived flaws with clothes, makeup, or physical barriers (Phillips et al., 2006). For men, the bodily focus tends to skew toward:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Muscularity/build (Phillips et al., 2006; Himanshu et al., 2020; Malcolm et al., 2021)</li>
      <li>Height (Himanshu et al., 2020)</li>
      <li>Thinning hair (Himanshu et al., 2020)</li>
    </ul>

    <p>It is important to note that there is a paucity of research on the ways BDD might impact people who identify as gender nonconforming or transgender, as bodily concerns among these populations are typically covering experiences with gender dysphoria. While gender dysphoria research is important, this potentially overlooks the experiences of these populations with body dysmorphia.</p>

    <h2>Associated Disorders and Risk</h2>
    <p>People with body dysmorphia are more likely to have experienced some form of trauma including bullying or childhood abuse or neglect. Dispositionally, people with BDD are more likely to be highly perfectionistic, feel significant shame (in general), and have high levels of negative emotions (Foroughi et al., 2019).</p>

    <p>Though BDD causes significant distress on its own, it is very common for people to experience body dysmorphia alongside other mental health concerns. Major depression, generalized anxiety, and social anxiety are quite common (APA, 2013). Additionally, approximately 32.5% of people with BDD also experience some sort of eating disorder (9% anorexia nervosa, 6.5% bulimia nervosa, and 17.5% eating disorder not otherwise specified; Ruffolo et al., 2006).</p>

    <p>Importantly, BDD is associated with significantly higher rates of suicidal thoughts, attempts, and completion. Approximately 80% of people with BDD experience suicidal thoughts, 25% of people with BDD report having attempted suicide in the past, and the suicide completion rate amongst people with BDD is 45 times greater than the general population (Vashi, 2016). This significant distress and greater risk levels makes BDD incredibly important to understand, diagnose, and treat.</p>

    <p>If you or someone you know is experiencing suicidal ideation (or another type of mental health crisis), call or text 988, the newly established mental health hotline. This service also offers chat features online. If you are experiencing or have experienced the other concerns listed here (trauma, depression, etc.), please seek support from a mental health provider in your local area.</p>

    <h2>Treatment</h2>
    <p>Despite this increased risk amongst folks with BDD, the research on treatments is quite limited. The limited research that has been conducted has examined both Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) and Exposure and Response Prevention (ERP). CBT focuses on the relationship between thoughts, behaviors, and emotions and gives people with BDD insight into how their bodily misperception (thoughts) leads to behaviors and emotions that cause distress in their life. ERP is a form of treatment in which people expose themselves to the anxiety-provoking stimulus (in this case, their perceived flaw) without allowing themselves to engage in the associated repetitive behaviors or thoughts. Together, CBT and ERP have been shown to be effective for treatment of BDD compared with placebo and waitlist control groups (Bjornsson et al., 2022). Note that any treatment for BDD should be done through working with a licensed mental health professional.</p>

    <p>There is also promising evidence that self-compassion can reduce the impact of perfectionism and negative emotions on one’s symptoms of body dysmorphia (Foroughi et al., 2019; Related: Managing your inner critic through self-compassion and How to practice and improve your self-compassion).</p>

    <p>With regards to pharmacological (medication) intervention, the bulk of the research indicates that SSRI’s (selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors) — commonly prescribed antidepressants — are most effective for treatment of BDD. Though the FDA has not yet approved SSRI’s in the treatment of BDD, it has been shown to be more effective than placebo in double-blind studies (Bjornsson et al., 2022).</p>

    <p>If you or someone you know is experiencing BDD, be sure to reach out for support from a mental health professional as well as friends, family, and other sources of social support.</p>

        <h1>Time Management Strategies</h1>
        
        <div class="section">
            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>Haley</p>
            <p>In this article, we defined time management, reviewed the literature on how helpful time management strategies are for our lives, and discussed the significant importance of priorities and balance in this process.</p>
            <p>Though research shows that time management skills generally improve our lives, there is no prescribed strategy or tool that has been shown to be more effective than others. This is because we are all different, and accommodating time management strategies is highly personal. I wanted to provide examples of what you can do to manage your time; therefore, I asked the content creators here at Fitness Blender to share their own perspectives on time management in order to give some ideas of what you can do. So, here are some of their strategies and tips!</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>Strategies and Personal Philosophies</h2>
            <p>The content creators have short, one-liner strategies and philosophies that help them in their time management journeys. While these may or may not work for you, it seems that it is helpful to have a general or broad goal for your time management that will allow you to be intentional about what is important.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>(Nicole)</strong> “If you fail to plan, you plan to fail.” - Benjamin Franklin</li>
                <li><strong>(Tasha)</strong> Be stubborn about your goals but flexible about your methods.</li>
                <li><strong>(Kayla)</strong> “No” is a complete sentence.</li>
                <li><strong>(Marina)</strong> Take things day by day. Set loose structure by prioritizing 1-3 items per day as a single point of focus.</li>
                <li><strong>(Marina)</strong> Know the time of day you work best on what tasks.</li>
                <li><strong>(Marina)</strong> Schedule time in between tasks to not overwhelm.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>Tools and Systems</h2>
            <p>Most (though not all) FB content creators use multiple systems or tools at one time. They seem to have worked through trial and error to try out different tools or systems for different purposes until they eventually found what worked best for them. Generally, they tend to use different methods for monthly, weekly, and daily tasks to help them keep track of both short- and long-term tasks and goals. Here are some of the tools they report using with descriptions of the lesser known systems.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Google Calendar</strong> (Tasha, Marina, Nicole)</li>
                <li><strong>Notes application on phone</strong> (Marina)</li>
                <li><strong>Word documents/spreadsheets</strong> (Tasha)</li>
                <li><strong>Notebooks/paper planners</strong> (Tasha, Amanda)</li>
                <li><strong>Sticky notes</strong> (Nicole)</li>
                <li><strong>Set reminders in phone</strong> (Nicole)</li>
                <li><strong>“Focus” app on iPhone:</strong> This is an iPhone feature that helps you concentrate by minimizing other distractions. When you need to focus, the phone will temporarily silence all notifications (or only allow certain notifications) and let other people and apps know you are busy. There are other similar systems available for Android and desktops (Kayla).</li>
                <li><strong>Asana Task Management System:</strong> A time management platform that helps you manage projects for individual or team use. You can easily organize, prioritize, collaborate, and track progress all in one location (Nicole).</li>
                <li><strong>Time blocking:</strong> Divide your day into blocks of time to accomplish a specific task or work on a larger project with multiple smaller tasks (Tasha).</li>
                <li><strong>Brain dump:</strong> Using some sort of system (pen and paper, word document, bulleted list, etc.) to empty all the contents of your mind into one single space. This helps you to declutter your mind and gain clarity on what is important to you at a single point in time (Marina).</li>
                <li><strong>Pomodoro technique:</strong> Time management system that breaks your workday into 25 minute working chunks separated by 5 minute breaks. Each of these intervals is considered one pomodoro. After four consecutive pomodoros, you will take a longer break. This helps you to prioritize and work on a single task at a time and also ensure you get rest and cognitive breaks throughout your day (Kayla).</li>
                <li><strong>Separate desktops for different purposes:</strong> On a mac, you can set up different desktops and/or different profiles for different purposes (work, personal tasks and work, leisure, etc.). This ensures you can focus on one purpose/role at a time and get only notifications and software that pertain to that role (Kayla).</li>

            <h2>Prioritizing Tasks</h2>
            <p>As discussed in part one, an important part of time management is prioritizing what is most/least important for all your personal goals. What does this look like? Here are some strategies used by our content creators:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>(Tasha)</strong> Categorized, monthly master to-do list that is prioritized within each category. Visit on a weekly basis to select foci for the week. Review this weekly list to select daily tasks. Revise as needed.</li>
                <li><strong>(Kayla)</strong> Prioritize tasks with deadlines (school, work, research, etc.) over things with floating deadlines.</li>
                <li><strong>(Nicole)</strong> Prioritize things that “move the needle” over busywork. Ask yourself “are these things actually important?” and focus on the most important things first. Schedule reminders for the others.</li>
                <li><strong>(Marina)</strong> Prioritizing is hard because everything I have going on in my life is something I want to do. There are no "should's" or "have to's" in my life. If tasks have a time constraint, I prioritize those in terms of what is coming up first. If the task is physical, I tend to schedule those in the morning because that's when I know I have the most energy; if it's something that I have resistance toward, I will schedule that first and the things I feel more excited about or have less resistance to I will schedule for later.</li>
                <li><strong>(Amanda)</strong> Schedule everything in your day (working out, walking the dog, showering, making food, driving places, etc.) so you make sure to leave time for the things that are important to you.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

            <h2>How to Protect Your Time</h2>
            <p>Like all of us, the FB content creators have situations in which procrastination and other time demands can overwhelm important tasks. Therefore, here are some of their tips for how they protect their time for their most important tasks.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>(Kayla)</strong> Non-negotiable and protected family time.</li>
                <li><strong>(Kayla)</strong> Daily protected work hours.</li>
                <li><strong>(Kayla)</strong> “Unplug” a few days per month where there is a boundary for no email, work, or work prep.</li>
                <li><strong>(Marina)</strong> Adapt, embrace, and cultivate a loving relationship with resistance. Understand where the resistance comes from, whether it is from fear of failure or a task no longer serving your needs. Learn to embrace it for what it is and work with it rather than against it.</li>
                <li><strong>(Marina)</strong> Set boundaries with yourself; you’re not a robot. Scheduling time for yourself is productivity because it fuels you to be able to do other things in your life.</li>
                <li><strong>(Nicole)</strong> Plan ahead. Knowing the game plan ahead of time helps things to run smoothly and allows you to get everything done.</li>
                <li><strong>(Tasha)</strong> When time-blocking, allow room to accommodate unexpected tasks or time for procrastination.</li>
                <li><strong>(Tasha)</strong> Intentionally alternate work and personal tasks to avoid burnout.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>Adapting to Changes</h2>
            <p>All of this being said, things pop up. It is inevitable that we will have other tasks that emerge at the last minute that are more important or life events that prevent us from being able to complete important tasks. Therefore, here are some strategies for how to adapt to these changes.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>(Tasha)</strong> Quickly reprioritize to accommodate and still finish other things.</li>
                <li><strong>(Tasha)</strong> If there is a major change, allow 5 minutes for a “freak out” and then tackle the new agenda like a puzzle. Figure out where it fits in and problem-solve to get it all done.</li>
                <li><strong>(Kayla)</strong> Prioritize protected time.</li>
                <li><strong>(Kayla)</strong> Reduce time spent on “soft” tasks like email or prep work.</li>
                <li><strong>(Marina)</strong> Remember that there is very little that you are in control of. However, you do have control over how you react or respond to the situation. That doesn’t mean you aren’t frustrated or disappointed, but rely on your intuition to know what to do next. Allow this process to be messy and learn from any outcome (even if you choose the “wrong” thing).</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>General Tips</h2>
            <p>I also asked for general time management tips, particularly those related to health and fitness goals. I thought their own words would speak better than I could possibly summarize. So, here they are with some editing for consistency and length!</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>(Tasha)</strong> I used to love striking through completed tasks on my to-do lists! Now I just delete them. I’ve trained myself to end the day feeling accomplished regardless of how many tasks I’ve completed that day, a decision I made a few years ago that freed me from tying my highly achievement-driven personality to my self-worth/confidence … This minor change helped me become even more flexible in my approach to getting things done and now I’m proud of the quality of what I finish in a day versus connecting my idea of success with the quantity of what I complete in a day.</li>
                <li><strong>(Tasha)</strong> Fitness/wellness is my life but fitness/wellness is not my world! You can have fitness goals and still fully enjoy all the other amazing aspects of life.</li>
                <li><strong>(Kayla)</strong> Do not underestimate the value of sleep quality in recovery, productivity, and wellness.</li>
                <li><strong>(Marina)</strong> Find movement that brings you joy and makes your body feel good. There is no single right way to take care of your body.</li>
                <li><strong>(Marina)</strong> Goals are great, but be patient and loving to your body; try not to beat yourself up if you don't reach your fitness goal "on time."</li>
                <li><strong>(Marina)</strong> Be consistent and fully present in your journey. Learn when your body needs rest. Learn when your body is asking to be pushed. Rest and resistance are BOTH required for growth physically (and mentally/emotionally).</li>
                <li><strong>(Marina)</strong> Persistence and tenacity. Learn when things are working and when time and effort are needed to reach your goal. Learn when things need to be adjusted/adapted and make those changes. This balance will look different for everyone in every goal. Embrace the process and use your goal as a single point of focus rather than focusing on an outcome you're attached to. This will allow you to stay committed and present in your process.</li>
                <li><strong>(Nicole)</strong> Plan ahead for the things you want to do, including workouts. Put it in your calendar or planner and show up as if you were showing up to a personal training session and someone is waiting for you. Make sure the people in your life know that this time is important to you.</li>
                <li><strong>(Nicole)</strong> Prioritize your tasks. Sometimes doing the dishes may feel more urgent, making it easier to push your workout to the back burner. But they are typically less important and can be done at another time.</li>
            </ul>

        <h1>Meditation Practice: How Much Is Enough?</h1>
        <div class="section">
            <p>As a mental health practitioner, I often get the question: “How much meditation will work?” Many times, the question stems from an all-or-nothing mindset where the individual falls into the pattern of thinking that you have to do something at 100% or not do it all. Sometimes it comes right when the topic is introduced and other times it comes when people have tried meditation a few times and indicate that it “didn’t work.”</p>
            <p>Regardless of the reason for the question, people often have a fear that they need to be meditating for long periods of time in order to see benefits of their meditation practice. They are worried about fitting yet another thing into their already busy lives. This fear then gets in their way of being able to form and sustain a regular meditation practice. So, what does the research say on how much meditation is “enough” meditation?</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>Frequency</h2>
            <p>Frequency of meditation practice seems to stand out as one of the more important components when it comes to meditation. Research shows that brief (~13 minutes), but regular (daily) meditation practice shows significant benefits for attention, working memory, and mood. These benefits were seen when the meditation was sustained for 8 weeks of consistent practice (Basso et al., 2019). Therefore, rather than focusing on how much time you need to devote to practice, the question becomes how long is reasonable for one to develop a consistent practice? To put this another way, I'll present a metaphor.</p>
            <p>When one practices for something else in their life (music, sports, art, etc.), they engage in regular practice so that when they are in a time of need (during a concert, game, or exhibition) they know what to do and feel competent. If one only practiced singing an Italian aria for ten minutes prior to their concert, they would likely not perform to their optimal level. Meditation is no different. We must practice frequently and consistently in order to reap the benefits for when we are in times of need.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>Amount of Time</h2>
            <p>People often want to know how long each meditation session should be. Do they need to practice for a whole hour per day or is a shorter practice as beneficial?</p>
            <p>Well, this depends on what you are using the meditation for. If you are looking for stress reduction, it will take a different amount of time to see results than if you are trying to improve concentration/focus, specific mental health benefits (i.e., depression), or working memory (as a few examples). Shorter practices at 10-20 minutes per day will certainly yield benefits to one’s levels of stress (Fan et al., 2013; Basso et al., 2019), general emotional states (reduction in negative and increase in positive emotions; Fredrickson et al., 2017), and even decrease mind-wandering and increase working memory capacity (Mrazek et al., 2013). However, if you are looking to significantly improve your concentration abilities (Shapiro & Walsh, 2003) or depression symptoms (Van Dam et al., 2014), for example, it might take both a longer practice and a longer period of time to see benefits. The outcomes that typically require support from a mental health professional (mental health or neurocognitive concerns) will likely take a bit longer and need to be practiced with support of a mental health professional.</p>
            <p>It does seem that the more one practices meditation, the greater the benefits they will see. One study showed that people who regularly practiced for longer and closely adhered to the tenets of their style of practice would experience greater benefits to their overall well-being (Lacaille et al., 2017). However, it is important to recognize that meditation is not intended to be something that hinders your daily life. Some folks try to jump headfirst into meditation with long practices, only to find that this causes them more stress and they give up altogether. Not to mention, a 45-minute daily practice is not feasible for most people.</p>
            <p>While the research varies, people tend to see reliable and significant benefits to their meditation practice after about 8 cumulative hours of meditation. I don’t mean you need to practice for 8 hours straight, but that if you practice 1 hour per day, you should see these results in about 8 days. If you practice for 10 minutes per day, it will take about a month and a half to fully realize the benefits. So, if you are practicing less each day, it may take longer to see results, but it is the consistent practice that will lead to results.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>An Additional Factor: Enjoyment</h2>
            <p>Outside of the factors of time and frequency of meditation, the amount of enjoyment or perceived benefit one gets from their practice impacts the likelihood that they will stick with the practice. One study found that people who enjoyed their first meditation practice (or first few) were significantly more likely to continue practicing for the next 21 days and practiced more over those 21 days than those who did not enjoy the meditation (Van Cappellen et al., 2020). Therefore, to establish the all-important consistent practice, finding what you enjoy doing for meditation may be particularly important.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section recommendations">
            <h2>Recommendations</h2>
            <p>So, how much should you meditate? I am aware that I didn’t exactly answer this question directly.</p>
            <p>I most commonly recommend that folks start with short practices of just a few minutes (3-5 minutes) each day. Over time, they then build that up to a longer practice that feels beneficial and sustainable to them. This way, they don’t burn themselves out from the start and are able to get in that consistent practice. However, it is helpful to find the longest duration that you can sustain across time. Our abilities and experiences of meditation can differ from day to day just like with exercise. While discipline is important, we also must be responsive to our mental, physical, and emotional needs in any given day or moment. This might mean occasional shorter or longer practices. Some days, you may get in just a few minutes. If a longer practice of 20-30 minutes per day works for you and your life, also great!</p>
            <p>For some other tips, I recommend finding early the types of meditation that you enjoy and that work best for your intended purpose. Of course, once you are comfortable with meditation, be sure to branch out and try different things, but knowing what you enjoy doing can help you to get in that frequent and consistent practice. It is also helpful to start out with guided practices (video/audio with the meditation prompts) to get accustomed to meditation before working your way up to practicing on your own. If you never practice on your own, that’s also okay!</p>

        <h1>Exercise and Panic Disorder</h1>
        <div class="section">
            <p>For folks with certain types of anxiety, namely panic disorder, exercise can be a catch 22 scenario. We know that exercise will make us feel better overall, but at the same time, exercise can sometimes lead to increases in anxiety and even trigger panic attacks. This article will explore why and when this tends to happen for people. Part 2 in this series will provide practical tips to help with the management of exercise-induced anxiety.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>What is Panic Disorder?</h2>
            <p>Before describing what panic disorder (PD) is, I first have to describe a panic attack. A panic attack is a bout of extreme anxiety that most commonly emerges via physical symptoms including, but not limited to, sweating, shaking, shortness of breath, heart palpitations, hot or cold flashes, sense of dread or intense fear, and much more. It is a good idea to first rule out physical causes — such as cardiac problems — if you are experiencing these symptoms. Panic attacks look different in different people, but regardless of the type of symptoms, people often describe wondering if they are having a heart attack or if they are dying while in the throes of a panic attack. This only increases their levels of panic and anxiety at the moment.</p>
            <p>Panic disorder is a specific type of anxiety disorder that is characterized by recurrent and unexpected panic attacks followed by one month or more of fear of having more panic attacks. Panic disorder will impact about 4.7% of US adults at some point in their lives, with women being more likely to experience it than men (Harvard Medical School, 2017).</p>
            <p>Panic disorder may or may not be accompanied by agoraphobia, or the fear of being in situations where escape might be difficult. With agoraphobia, the fear is that a panic attack might happen at any moment and getting to a place of perceived safety would be difficult or impossible. Often, this results in people avoiding situations they anticipate will cause anxiety, like public transportation, open or enclosed spaces, standing in lines, or crowds. In its most severe forms, people have a difficult time leaving their home at all.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>Exercise-induced Panic Attacks</h2>
            <p>For folks with panic disorder, exercise can sometimes be a trigger for increased anxiety or for panic attacks. There are many theories as to why this is, and here are a few:</p>
            <p><strong>Autonomic dysregulation:</strong> If you think back to the fight-or-flight series, the autonomic nervous system (ANS) regulates breathing, blood pressure, heart rate, and circulation. Within the ANS we have the sympathetic (fight-or-flight) and parasympathetic (rest) nervous systems. Folks with panic disorder experience autonomic dysfunction — in which their sympathetic nervous system is hypersensitive and overactive — and have less activation in their parasympathetic nervous system. This results in increased sensitivity to stressors and difficulties using techniques to calm the body down when they do experience those stressors. Exercise is one such stressor that, even though desirable, the body cannot distinguish between and leads to increased anxiety (Muotri & Bernik, 2014).</p>
            <p><strong>Conditioning:</strong> The physiological symptoms of a panic attack (described above) overlap significantly with some of the symptoms of exercise, namely, shortness of breath, sweating, dizziness, etc. These feelings have been conditioned or associated over time with panic. Therefore, when people start to exercise and experience these feelings, they associate them with a panic attack. This cognitive association then perpetuates the presence of the panic attack.</p>
            <p><strong>Increased lactic acid buildup:</strong> Lactic acid is a compound created by the body during intense workouts. We are well aware that this lactic acid buildup leads to sore muscles, but it also impacts the brain. Some folks have difficulties clearing the lactic acid from their brain and this leads to a hypersensitive amygdala (emotion center of the brain). Therefore, when people engage in vigorous physical activity, their body increases lactate and can lead to panic attacks (Martinsen et al., 1998).</p>
            <p>Technically, anyone could experience anxiety or panic during exercise, but folks with panic disorder or family histories of anxiety disorders are more likely to experience them.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>Impact of the Type of Workout</h2>
            <p>It is not exactly clear from the research which types of workouts are most likely to lead to panic symptoms; however, we know anecdotally that people tend to experience them during higher intensity cardiovascular workouts. Harkening back to the conditioning explanation above, within high intensity cardio workouts (like HIIT), our bodies quickly reach the physiological state that reminds us of a panic attack. When we are unable to then either cognitively distinguish that an increased heart rate from exercise is actually a good thing and/or stop our bodies from automatically spiraling into a panic attack, we feel little control over our levels of anxiety.</p>
            <p>However, research shows that mild to moderately intense exercise does lead to a reduction in anxiety in the long-term (Ströhle et al., 2009; Lattari et al., 2018) and there is even burgeoning research that shows high-intensity exercise can be tolerated by folks with panic disorder under the right conditions (Plag et al., 2019). In particular, gradually increasing your heart rate with a longer warm-up and easing into the high intensity portions can help signal to the mind and body that this is a good and intended physiological response.</p>

        <h1>Overview</h1>
        <p><strong>Candice</strong></p>
        <p>While preparing to get pregnant can be a joyful time, it can also be stressful, especially when we experience issues such as infertility, pregnancy loss, or mental health concerns. So much of the advice we get when trying to get pregnant focuses on the baby-to-be, but how can we make sure we are taking care of ourselves when our path to parenthood seems stormy and unclear? Let’s explore some perinatal challenges and strategies for moving forward.</p>

        <h2>Infertility</h2>
        <p>Infertility rates are difficult to track globally due to vast cultural differences in how fertility is understood and reported. One estimate suggests that as many as 48.5 million couples may experience difficulty conceiving — that’s roughly 15 percent of couples, and doesn’t include single folks trying to have children. For women, an inability to conceive is often related to underlying conditions such as Polycystic Ovary Syndrome, low egg reserve, or hormonal abnormalities. For men, conditions such as diabetes or autoimmune disorders or behavioral concerns such as substance use could be at play. Frustratingly, nearly one third of all folks dealing with infertility will not be able to pinpoint a reason, which can negatively impact individual and relationship health during what is already one of the most stressful events a couple can face.</p>

        <h2>Pregnancy loss</h2>
        <p>Pregnancy loss is a painful topic that many expectant parents avoid discussing, despite the fact that anywhere from 10 to 20 percent of pregnancies will miscarry, most within the first 12 weeks after implantation. Most miscarriages result from abnormalities within the developing fetus, but many expectant parents blame themselves. In her book on psychotherapy, fertility, and pregnancy loss, psychologist Janet Jaffe reflects, “Because it is medically common, the impact of miscarriage is often underestimated.” As such, lingering grief and fear of losing future pregnancies can go unnoticed and untended.</p>

        <h2>Strategies for moving forward</h2>
        <p>Many of us try to get pregnant with a heart full of hope and exciting expectations for our lives as parents. When those dreams fall short, negative emotion is unavoidable and often overwhelming. Our natural urge to make sense of painful events can manifest in finger pointing or feelings of guilt, which can harm us and our relationships.</p>
        <p>It’s easy to get stuck in loops of self-blame, beating ourselves up for having too much caffeine, for not going to a specialist sooner for our uterine fibroids, or for struggling with the eating disorder that threw off our hormone levels. Or perhaps we blame our partners, angrily cataloguing every bad decision we imagine contributed to problems conceiving. But so often our guilt and blame are distractions from grief. If we can pause with the pain of loss rather than defend against it with criticism, we increase our resilience and compassion, preserving our relationships with ourselves and our partners in the process.</p>
        <p>Below are some tips for moving forward.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Seek support:</strong> Groups for pregnancy loss and infertility can be a safe space to process feelings of sadness, anger, grief, and guilt with folks who are in the same boat. Groups are often sponsored by OBGYN offices, midwives, doulas, and other reproductive health providers.</li>
            <li><strong>Use “I” statements:</strong> Staying connected with your partner during this challenging time is easier if there’s room for you both to express how you’re feeling. Using language such as “I feel” instead of externalizing language such as “you always” or “you never” invites support rather than defensiveness.</li>
            <li><strong>Ritual:</strong> We have elaborate social rituals (funerals, wakes, and other cultural practices) for when a loved one dies, but when our losses are not as tangible, as is the case with fertility struggles and pregnancy loss, our pain does not have an established outlet, resulting in what mental health professionals call disenfranchised grief. To help heal, consider creating your own ritual practice to help process the loss, inviting in trusted friends and supports.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>History of mental illness</h2>
        <p>It’s not uncommon for us to question how pregnancy will impact our well-being, but the issue can be even more complicated for folks with histories of mental illness such as depression, anxiety, obsessive compulsive disorder, or bipolar disorder. Folks with mental illness have to consider whether to stay on or go off of medications when pregnant and how pregnancy could impact symptoms. Having a mental illness prior to getting pregnant increases the risk of perinatal mood and anxiety disorders (even if symptoms are in remission at the time of pregnancy). Let’s break down some strategies for prevention and care.</p>

        <h3>Who’s on your team:</h3>
        <p>Having a supportive and knowledgeable care team can help prevent negative outcomes. If you have the option to choose your doctor, consider asking them how they approach treatment for folks with histories of mental illness. Do they recommend discontinuing or staying on medication and why? How will they screen for changes in psychiatric symptoms during the pregnancy and what sort of support do they offer post pregnancy should symptoms increase or change? Regarding medication, it’s important to know that your providers are taking your wellness into account as well as your baby’s. The risks of going off medications can outweigh the potential benefits if symptoms return while you’re pregnant.</p>

        <h3>Track your experience:</h3>
        <p>There are so many physical and emotional changes that can happen during pregnancy, it can be hard to know what’s “normal” and what’s problematic. Keeping a bullet journal of moods, energy levels, and action urges (such as wanting to self harm, isolate, or any impulsive urges) can help you and your care team be responsive to changes.</p>

        <h3>Broaden your tool box:</h3>
        <p>The tools available to cope with psychiatric symptoms may shift during and after pregnancy. If running is your go-to symptom management strategy, you’ll likely need other options for late pregnancy and as your body heals postpartum, especially if you have a cesarean section. Consider coping strategies that you could use no matter what your level of mobility so you can stay on top of self care as your body changes.</p>

        <h2>General tips for prenatal stress management</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Move your body:</strong> There are plenty of reasons that physical movement supports a healthy pregnancy, but it can also be a strong protective factor against perinatal mood and anxiety disorders. It’s important to be responsive to your body’s changing needs during and after pregnancy however, so listen to your body and/or consult with a professional regarding safe perinatal exercises.</li>
            <li><strong>Limit your research:</strong> With so much information available to us regarding what to do and what not to do to ensure a healthy pregnancy, it’s easy to get overwhelmed. Stay informed, but put some limits around how much time and energy you spend trying to figure out if every little change is normal or an indicator of a problem. These boundaries will help you to manage your stress levels.</li>
            <li><strong>Establish a mindfulness practice:</strong> Mindfulness practices such as yoga and meditation can improve how our bodies and minds respond to stress, and can even help folks in recovery from postpartum mood disorders. Adding mindfulness to your daily life before getting pregnant or during your pregnancy helps to set the stage to maintain the habit during those intense newborn days.</li>
        </ul>
